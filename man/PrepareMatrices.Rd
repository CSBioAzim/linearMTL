\title{Precompute matrices XTX and XTY for \code{\link{TreeGuidedGroupLasso}}.}
\usage{
PrepareMatrices(Y, X = NULL, task.specific.features = list(),
  standardize = TRUE, row.weights = NULL, return.inputs = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{N by K output matrix for every task.}

\item{X}{N by J1 matrix of features common to all tasks.}

\item{task.specific.features}{Named list of features which are specific to
each task. Each entry contains an N by J2 matrix for one particular task
(where columns are features). List has to be ordered according to the
columns of Y.}

\item{standardize}{Standardize data (default is TRUE).}

\item{row.weights}{Observation weights.}

\item{return.inputs}{Return transformed (scaled and weighted, if applicable)
version of X, Y and task.specific.features.}
}
\value{
List containing Y, X, task.specific.features, XTX, XTY, XT1 and YT1.
  Also return means and standard deviations for Y and all inputs.
}
\description{
Computes XTX and XTY. If task specific features are supplied, the result will
be a list containing the respective matrices for each task.
